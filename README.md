# RadhaPolyClinic
In this project, i made an attempt to build an informational website for a Polyclinic. I made this in such way that i can book your appointments with the Doctor, if he's idle . And you can get into the website only after registering yourself as a user, yes i have built an authentication system to this application. MongoDB is the database i used to create record of users, contact queries, appointments. And it contains a very smooth UI . I have written the backend of this application using Flask Web Micro Framework and few Python Modules and packages. Thank You


# Running This Application
It includes making the source files to the right repository path and then just run the apllication

# Development
As of now, this of mine not full-fleged, development of it is still going on. Once i get done with this. I"ll write a full informational readme.md and add requirements. txt file too about the modules and packages i used during development. Until that , you can view my just view my code and implementation.
